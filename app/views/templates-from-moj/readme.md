# Templates from MOJ Design System

This folder contains the templates copied from the MOJ Design system for all the different pages.

They are used for reference if they need to be added into the prototype kit. You can get most of the pages work by converting to .html and adding the basic layout files.

Adding examples and code to the components is not very straight forward. I've managed to hack the add another component to show a working version but it is not clickable.
